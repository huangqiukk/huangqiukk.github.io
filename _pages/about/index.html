<p>Greetings, my name is HUANG Qiuyuan and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Biomaterial Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo. I am passionate about the development of sustainable materials and dedicated to contributing to the fields of eco-friendly polymers, eco-materials, biodegradable plastics, polymer structure and polymer synthesis.</p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, where my research focused on biodegradable polymers. Since then, I have continued my research journey and my current work focuses on the development of innovative biodegradable polymers that are both environmentally friendly and sustainable.</p>

<p>I am honoured to have the opportunity to work with a team of brilliant researchers at the University of Tokyo and to contribute to the development of sustainable materials that will shape the future of our planet.</p>
